## Turn 1: USER

First, get familiar with the available roles in the system, then analyze the network architecture by examining devices at different locations. I want to understand the network design patterns - what types of devices are typically deployed at different location types (Data Centers vs Campuses vs Branches), and how the device naming conventions relate to their roles. Can you identify any architectural patterns or inconsistencies?

### Architectural Patterns and Inconsistencies

1. **Device Types and Roles**:
   - Data centers predominantly use **Core**, **Leaf**, and **Spine** roles with Arista devices, indicating a modern architecture for handling high traffic loads.
   - Campuses use **Campus Access** devices (mostly Cisco Catalyst 9300) and WAN devices (Cisco ISR 4321), suggesting a focus on combining access switching with routing capabilities.
   - Branch offices also predominantly use **Branch Access** and **WAN** roles with a clear focus on providing reliable access through Catalyst 9300 switches.

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Naming conventions seem consistent where device names start with location codes (e.g., "NYDC-", "DACN-", "BRCN-") followed by device roles or types, which helps in identifying the geographic and functional context of devices quickly.

3. **Inconsistencies**: 
   - There seems to be a lack of **Core** devices in some campuses like **DACN** and **LOCN**, which could indicate potential architectural weaknesses especially if they need to route significant amounts of traffic.
   - Variability in the number of devices per role in branch offices can also indicate inconsistency in capacity planning.

### Conclusion
The network design shows a clear distinction in roles and device types based on the location type (Data Centers, Campuses, Branch Offices). However, further exploration into planning for redundancy and capacity, especially in campuses that lack core devices, would be beneficial. Overall, the architecture appears planned with room for enhancements.

### Analysis of Network Connectivity Patterns:

1. **Common Providers**:
   - Both **AT&T** and **Cogent** dominate the circuit landscape with several MPLS and Internet WAN circuits listed across multiple locations. 

2. **Types of Circuits**:
   - There’s a mix of **MPLS** and **Internet WAN** across different providers, with MPLS circuits primarily found in specific campuses (Korea, Mexico, London, and Brazil), indicating a centralized architecture designed for reliability and performance.
   - The remaining circuits are primarily Internet WAN, indicating supplementary connectivity, particularly in branch offices.

3. **Redundancy Patterns**:
   - Many branch locations have **backup** Internet WAN circuits from providers such as **CenturyLink** and **Level 3**, which offer a level of redundancy. Since the physical circuits are carried by different providers, this decreases the likelihood of a total service disruption due to provider issues.

4. **Single Points of Failure**:
   - There are locations, like MXBN2 and USBN1, that have only Internet WAN circuits and no MPLS connectivity, which can pose a risk if a single provider fails. Lack of diversity in connectivity in certain branches can result in potential single points of failure.
   - Branch Offices like **USBN5** and **BRBN1/BRBN2** entirely lack connectivity for priority circuits (e.g., no MPLS), making them reliant on their respective Internet WAN circuits.

### Conclusion
The current network architecture showcases effective use of redundancy and reliable connectivity through widely utilized providers. However, attention is needed in ensuring that all branch offices have alternative MPLS connectivity or multiple Internet WAN providers to mitigate risks of outages and enhance network resilience. It would also be beneficial to incorporate additional MPLS circuits in locations without any currently, thereby ensuring comprehensive coverage and decreasing risk.

## Turn 5: USER

Get devices at a few different locations, then examine their interfaces. I want to understand how interfaces are described and how they connect to circuits. Look for patterns in interface descriptions that indicate circuit connections vs internal network connections. Can you identify which interfaces are likely WAN connections and which are internal network connections?

### Analysis of Interface Descriptions

#### Patterns in Interface Descriptions

1. **WAN Connections**:
   - Interfaces on WAN devices (like `DALCN-WAN01`, `DALCN-WAN02`, `BRBN1-WAN01`) have descriptions such as "Internet WAN" or "Core network uplink" which indicate external connections to service providers.
   - The specific circuit connection is provided for interfaces tied to WAN connections (e.g., `BRBN1-WAN01` to "CKT-BRB1-INT-001").

2. **Internal Network Connections**:
   - Interfaces with descriptions like "Link to ACC01", "User Access Port" indicate internal networking connections primarily for local traffic management.
   - Devices described as Leaf or Campus Access (like `DALCN-ACC01` and `BRBN1-SW01`) have multiple user access ports, suggesting they connect end-user devices to the network but do not directly connect to external circuits.

#### Identification of Connection Types

- **WAN Connections**:
   - `BRBN1-WAN01`: Clearly marked as an Internet WAN with a specific circuit ID and external IP address.
   - `DALCN-COR01` interfaces connecting to other WANs (like WAN01 and WAN02).

- **Internal Network Connections**:
   - `DALCN-ACC01` interfaces (Ethernet1/x) that connect to the core routers (`DALCN-COR01` and `DALCN-COR02`) or as user access ports (Ethernet1/3, 1/4, etc.).

### Conclusion

The analysis reveals a clear distinction in interface descriptions and their functions within the network. WAN connections are specifically marked and provide connectivity to external circuits, while internal connections facilitate local traffic among access and core devices. This hierarchy illustrates good network design, segregating traffic appropriately and allowing for expansion and redundancy through spare interfaces where needed.

## Turn 7: USER

Get prefixes from multiple locations and analyze the IP addressing scheme. I want to understand how the network address space is organized - are there patterns in how subnets are allocated to different location types, what roles are assigned to different prefix ranges, and how the addressing scheme supports the network architecture?

---

## Turn 8: ASSISTANT

### Analysis of IP Addressing Scheme Across Different Locations

Here is a detailed overview of the prefixes from multiple locations, followed by an analysis of the addressing scheme's organization, as well as patterns in subnet allocation and role assignment.

#### 1. **Prefixes in Different Locations**

##### **NYDC (New York Data Center)**
- **Main Prefix**: 
  - 10.10.0.0/16 - Data center network for NYC
- **Subnets**: 
  - 10.10.0.0/24 - Subnet 1
  - 10.10.50.0/24 - Subnet 2
  - 10.10.100.0/24 - Subnet 3
- **Spine-Leaf Connections**: 
  - Multiple /31 prefixes for inter-device connections within the spine-leaf architecture.

##### **DACN (Dallas Campus)**
- **Main Prefix**: 
  - 10.1.0.0/16 - Main network for Dallas Campus
- **Subnets**: 
  - 10.1.0.0/24 - Subnet 1
  - 10.1.50.0/24 - Subnet 2
  - 10.1.100.0/24 - Subnet 3

##### **KOCN (Korea Campus)**
- **Main Prefix**: 
  - 10.3.0.0/16 - Main network for Korea Campus
- **Subnets**: 
  - 10.3.0.0/24 - Subnet 1
  - 10.3.50.0/24 - Subnet 2
  - 10.3.100.0/24 - Subnet 3
- **Core Network**: 
  - 10.30.0.0/16 - Core network
  - Additional subnets for the core similar to the main.

##### **MXCN (Mexico Campus)**
- **Main Prefix**: 
  - 10.5.0.0/16 - Main network for Mexico Campus
- **Subnets**: 
  - 10.5.0.0/24 - Subnet 1
  - 10.5.50.0/24 - Subnet 2
  - 10.5.100.0/24 - Subnet 3
- **Core Network**: 
  - 10.50.0.0/16 - Core network, with similar subnet structure as the main network.

##### **BRCN (Brazil Campus)**
- **Main Prefix**: 
  - 10.4.0.0/16 - Main network for Brazil Campus
- **Subnets**: 
  - 10.4.0.0/24 - Subnet 1
  - 10.4.50.0/24 - Subnet 2
  - 10.4.100.0/24 - Subnet 3
- **Core Network**: 
  - 10.40.0.0/16 - Core network with a similar addressing scheme.

#### 2. **Analysis of Addressing Scheme**

- **Allocation Patterns**: 
  - Each location contains a **/16** prefix for its main network, followed by several **/24** subnets for logical separation of different functions or areas within the campus or data center.
  - Subnets are consistently named to suggest organization (e.g., Subnet 1, Subnet 2).

- **Roles of Prefixes**:
  - The **/16** subnet is designated for main connectivity, while the **/24** subnets within each location can be used for segmenting user access, server farms, or specific departments.
  - **/31** prefixes are exclusively used for inter-device connections (Spine-Leaf connections) within the NYDC's spine-leaf architecture, optimizing point-to-point links while conserving address space.

- **Support for Network Architecture**:
  - The structured approach in prefix allocation supports an easily understandable hierarchy, aiding in network management and scalability.
  - Each campus or data center utilizes a similar structure, which facilitates clear documentation and network operations for teams that manage multiple locations.
  - Core networks (**10.30.0.0**, **10.50.0.0**, **10.40.0.0**) imply dedicated addressing for higher-level switches and routers, enabling better traffic management and reduced routing complexity.

### Conclusion

The IP addressing scheme across different locations shows a well-organized structure where network address space is systematically allocated based on role and location. Main networks are established with consistent subnetting strategies, and the use of specific prefixes for different roles (main network, core network, spine-leaf connections) effectively supports the overall network architecture. This examination suggests a robust and resilient design that promotes both connectivity and efficient resource use, while making future expansions more manageable.

**Overall Feedback**: The network is generally well-documented, with all prefixes having relevant descriptions. 

#### 4. **Potential Issues Identified**
Here are some issues found during the assessment:

- **Devices Without IP Addresses**:
  - **NYDC**: All devices reported have no assigned primary IP addresses.
  - **DACN**: All devices reported have no assigned primary IP addresses.
  - **BRCN**: Similar condition as above.
  - **KOCN**: Same situation as above.
  - **MXCN**: Devices also lack primary IP addresses.
  - **LODC**: Devices also do not have primary IP addresses noted.
  - **LOCN**: Lack of assigned primary IP addresses.
  - **USBN1/2/BRBN1/2/MXBN1/2**: All listed devices also lack primary IP addresses.

### Conclusion
The network is well-organized and well-documented across various locations. There is a strong structure in terms of device roles, types of circuits, and subnetting. However, a significant issue is identified with multiple active devices lacking primary IP addresses, which could hinder effective network management and functionality.

    url = f"{NAUTOBOT_API_URL}dcim/devices/?location={location}"
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response.json()['results']

# Function to fetch circuits by location
def fetch_circuits(location):
    url = f"{NAUTOBOT_API_URL}circuits/circuit-terminations/?location={location}"
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response.json()['results']

# Function to fetch prefixes by location
def fetch_prefixes(location):
    url = f"{NAUTOBOT_API_URL}ipam/prefixes/?location={location}"
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

for loc in locations:
    if device_count[loc] > 0:
        print(f"Check devices in {loc}: {device_count[loc]} devices found.")

```

### Explanation and Setup Instructions

1. **Configure Variables**:
   - Set your `NAUTOBOT_API_URL` to point to your Nautobot API base URL (e.g., `"http://your-nautobot-url/api/"`).
   - Enter the `API_TOKEN` with a valid Nautobot API token.

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - The script calls the following endpoints:
     - `dcim/devices/?location={location}`: Fetch devices.
     - `circuits/circuit-terminations/?location={location}`: Fetch circuits.
     - `ipam/prefixes/?location={location}`: Fetch prefixes.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - The script maintains counts of devices, common circuit types, and prefix documentation quality by location.
   - It also checks for devices without primary IP addresses.

4. **Run the Script**:
   - Ensure you have `requests` library installed: 
     ```bash
     pip install requests
     ```
   - Execute the script to get results printed to the console.

### Final Note
Make sure that you have the necessary permissions to access the API and that your Nautobot instance is running and reachable from where you execute this script. The code handles basic data aggregation and checks, but you may expand it as necessary for deeper analysis or additional features.
