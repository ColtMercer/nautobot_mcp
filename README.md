## ü§ù Contributing New Tools

To add new MCP tools to the server:

### **1. Add Tool Function**
Create your tool function in `services/mcp-nautobot/mcp_server/tools/` directory.

### **2. Register Tool in Server**
Add the tool to `services/mcp-nautobot/mcp_server/server.py`:

```python
# Create Tool instance
my_tool = Tool.from_function(
    fn=my_tool_function,
    name="my_tool_name",
    description="""Detailed description of what the tool does.

        Args:
            param1: Description of parameter 1
            param2: Description of parameter 2

        Returns:
            Description of what the tool returns
        """
)

# Add to server
server.add_tool(my_tool)
```

### **3. Tool Descriptions & LLM Communication**
The `description` field is crucial - it's what the LLM reads to understand:
- **What the tool does**
- **What parameters it accepts**
- **What it returns**
- **Example values and formats**

The LLM uses this description to decide when and how to call your tool. Be specific and include examples!

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **General Issues**
- **Services not starting**: Check `docker-compose logs` for errors
- **Chat UI not loading**: Ensure all services are healthy with `docker-compose ps`
- **API errors**: Verify your `NAUTOBOT_TOKEN` is set correctly in `.env`

### **Seed Data Issues**

If you're not seeing data in your queries, the seed container may have failed:

1. **Check seed container logs:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs seed-data
   ```

2. **Look for common seed errors:**
   - Connection timeouts to Nautobot
   - Authentication failures
   - Database constraint violations
   - Missing dependencies

3. **Rerun seed container if needed:**
   ```bash
   # Stop and remove the seed container
   docker-compose rm -f seed-data
   
   # Restart it to rerun the seeding process
   docker-compose up -d seed-data
   
   # Check logs again
   docker-compose logs -f seed-data
   ```

4. **Verify data was created:**
   - Go to http://localhost:8080 and log into Nautobot
   - Check that locations, devices, and prefixes exist
   - If no data exists, the seed process failed

5. **Common seed container issues:**
   - **Nautobot not ready**: Seed container starts before Nautobot is fully initialized
   - **Network connectivity**: Container can't reach Nautobot API
   - **Permission issues**: API token doesn't have sufficient permissions
   - **Database locks**: Concurrent operations causing conflicts
